# OpenBank
 
The Api was created using DDD and entity framework core (with a generic repository aproach);

As usually banks use their own criptography methods, I choose to create a class to criptography the password and check the validation of it, instead of using identy framework form dotnet;

I also used dotnet entity framework migrations to generate and update the database;

I implemented swagger to use as a minimal documentation for API use;
